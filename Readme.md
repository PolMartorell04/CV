-CV Project analysis:

1. User profile: 

The final user for my website is designed to be someone that looks to hire young people, currently studying to work only holidays and weekends or to combine the job with  the studies from the employees. This person is someone who looks for an original, visual and formal CV. 

This individual, other than finding out speficic information about me like my formation and where I've worked, is someone who looks to learn a bit more about myself (what I  do in my free time, what projects I've been working on, etc). By just reading my CV (my skills and languages, for example), he/she wants to value if I would be capable of doing  the job they would offer me. 


2. Information architecture:

There are 2 main sections in his cv. The "left section" basically contains specific information about me. First of all, and I personally think the most important, a photo of me.  I think it's the first think that most people look at when they are starting to read a CV. Of course, under the photo there's my full name and under it, my current status (student of  a Computer Engineering degree). Next, I have listed some ways to contact me, both my phone number and home humber, my mail adress and my adress at Girona, where I live and  study. Last but not least, there's personal information about me, like my date of birth, some qualities about me or hobbies I like doing. 

Moving to the "righ section", we can see five main sub-sections:

    a. My formation. The final user can see where I've studied and what I've studied during recent years (since i finished elementary school). I also mention a guidance formation title I have.

    b. Languages. I think it's almost compulsory to mention which languages someone speaks (and the level). I mention mines accompanied by their respective flags.

    c. Work experience. I talk about my general work experience since I started working four years ago. I mention some of them, but the five more important have an animation to show in a more visual way what they are and there's a small description when the animation ends.

    d. Skills. We can find six charging bars (they charge when someone refreshes or opens the page with an animation). Each bar has a programming language and how many percent of it I've learned.

    e. Projects. We can see three images and titles of three "big" projects I've developped in high school and baccalaureate. When someone puts their cursor on the image, a button appears with the name of the project on it. If they click it, they will be directec to a github page with the files of each project.


3. Visual design:

First of all, I want to mention the colours and disposition I have used. Above all, the main colour I have played with is blue. The main background is blue, to difference it from usual CV and to match with other types of blue I use. All the left section is in colour blue (blue sea more or less). I have put this colour because the left section represents personal information and data about me, and since blue is my favourite colour I think it's suitable to represent this section. The right section is white to make it more formal as it contains more "documented" information.

Left-section:

First, as every CV, my photo, full name and current status. I've decided to put my contact information using also icons, so everyone can relate the information easier. Next I've written more personal details, so the final user can learn more about me and make an idea about how I am. Everything is in white to make it read better.

Right-section:

Five main sub-sections. The same title on every sub-section to make the structure even more clear. 

    1 MY FORMATION: There's three formations I've attended and an icon to make it visually better.

    2 LANGUAGES: four languages i speak, which level do I have and the respective flags to each language.

    3 WORK EXPERIENCE: here we can find the first animation. There's a text that talks about my work experience and then there's five pictures. Each picture shows a place I've worked at and, if someone puts the cursor on a picture, it turns in a animated way and shows a brief text about what is it. I have put this animation to implement something more visual with css.

    4 SKILLS: we can appreciate six programming languages I have worked with. It shows in a percentatge how much I have learned from every language. It also has an animation where, if you refresh or charge the web, the bars charge progressively from first to last. I think it's a cool way to show how much I have learned and doesn't need much explanation.

    5 PROJECTS: at the end, we can find a text explaining this section. I wanted to explain the three most important projects I have developped in my career as student. I have put a lot of efford into them and I think they can show how I am as a programmer and as a thinking individual. If anyone wants to know more about them, if they put their cursor on the image of every project, it will appear a button that will direct them to a github repository with the code or information about that project. This is a nice way to show how I developped them and to have something more modern on my CV.
